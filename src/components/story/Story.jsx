              Hamal and Ayesha's journey began in the most unexpected of times
              and places—a Zoom meeting in the midst of the global pandemic in
              2020. Introduced by a mutual friend, sparks flew almost
              immediately, at least for Hamal, who found Ayesha cute. Ayesha, on
              the other hand, initially believed that Hamal was married and
              chose to ignore him.

              At that time, Hamal was residing in Pakistan, while Ayesha called
              Melbourne, Australia home. It wasn't long before Ayesha realized
              that Hamal was indeed single, and their paths converged in a more
              meaningful way. They decided to take a Zoom sign language class
              together, and through shared virtual experiences, a friendship
              slowly blossomed. Hamal frequently commented on the mouth-watering
              food photos Ayesha posted, a gesture that helped bridge the
              distance between them. The way to a mans heart is truly through
              the stomach.

              When Hamal moved back home to New York in 2021, their
              conversations became more frequent, and their bond grew stronger.
              Despite their growing connection, they remained cautious about
              entering into a relationship since they had not yet met in person.
              Early in 2022, when Australia lifted travel restrictions, Hamal
              flew to Melbourne to meet Ayesha for the first time. By then, they
              had developed a close friendship that laid the foundation for
              their relationship.

              Their first date was at a Korean Fried Chicken restaurant, where
              Ayesha, breaking with tradition, paid the bill. Their second date
              was a “charming” breakfast at McDonald's, where Hamal happily
              covered the cost. Since that initial meeting, Hamal has made four
              trips to Australia, perfecting his Australian accent along the
              way. Ayesha, too, has visited Hamal in the U.S. and fell in love
              with New York, eagerly anticipating her move there.

              The pinnacle of their journey came on April 15, 2023, in
              Melbourne, where they got engaged, surrounded by friends who made
              the day unforgettable. Having navigated the challenges of a
              long-distance relationship for nearly four years, they have become
              experts at making the most of their time apart. Now, as they
              prepare to close the distance, Hamal and Ayesha look forward to
              building a future together, cherishing every moment as their love
              story continues to unfold.
